\begin{abstract}
This document reports a one-dimensional simulation of the transport of argon ions across a plasma sheath and through a
retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA). The simulation can model DC and AC sheaths. The DC sheath is modeled using Child Law
and the AC sheath using the analytical solution of a radio-frequency capacitive sheath by M. A. Lieberman. The model includes
elastic and charge exchange ion collisions with background Argon gas.

The RFEA is located at $z\le0$; with the plasma facing grid (G$_0$) at $z=0$. The location of the RFEA grids and collector are indicated by vertical dashed lines.}
