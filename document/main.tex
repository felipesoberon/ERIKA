\begin{abstract}
This document reports a one-dimensional simulation of the transport of argon ions across a plasma sheath and through a
retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA). The simulation can model DC and AC sheaths. The DC sheath is modeled using Child Law
and the AC sheath using the analytical solution of a radio-frequency capacitive sheath by M. A. Lieberman. The model includes
elastic and charge exchange ion collisions with background Argon gas.

\section{\label{Introduction}Introduction}

Retarding field analyzers are employed to assess the energy distribution of ions impinging on a surface. Ions acquire considerable kinetic energy as a result of the high voltage across the plasma sheath. This energy distribution is valuable in various applications, such as space propulsion equipment. In other contexts, such as the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, plasma etching equipment, or plasma deposition, the ion energy serves as a parameter that can influence the etch rate, the profile of the process, or the deposition rate.

RFEA devices can be designed as an array of thin grids tightly packed together, with a series of voltages applied to these grids. The primary purpose of this configuration is to select ions based on their energy and to eliminate the detection of electrons originating from the plasma discharge or secondary electrons emitted by the RFEA following ion impact. 

The operational range of RFEA devices is limited by several factors, including background gas pressure, fast electrons from the plasma, secondary electrons emitted within the RFEA, ionization occurring inside the RFEA, the distance between RFEA grids, and field distortion within the RFEA caused by space charge.

To assess the impact of any of the factors mentioned above, a computer simulation of a plasma sheath and RFEA grid would enable one to explore these factors individually or in combination.

Here we report a one-dimensional model of a plasma sheath and RFEA device.

Citations in text refer to entries in the Bibliography;
they use the commands \verb+\cite{#1}+ or \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+. 
Because REV\TeX\ uses the \verb+natbib+ package of Patrick Daly, 
its entire repertoire of commands are available in your document;
see the \verb+natbib+ documentation for further details.
The argument of \verb+\cite+ is a comma-separated list of \emph{keys};
a key may consist of letters and numerals. 

By default, AAPM citations are numerical; \cite{feyn54} 
to give a textual citation, use \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+: (Refs.~\onlinecite{witten2001,epr,Bire82}). 
REV\TeX\ ``collapses'' lists of consecutive numerical citations when appropriate. 
To illustrate, we cite several together \cite{feyn54,witten2001,epr,Berman1983}, 
and once again (Refs.~\onlinecite{epr,feyn54,Bire82,Berman1983}). 
Note that, when numerical citations are used, the references were sorted into the same order they appear in the bibliography. 

A reference within the bibliography is specified with a \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ command,
where the argument is the citation key mentioned above. 
\verb+\bibitem{#1}+ commands may be crafted by hand or, preferably,
generated by using Bib\TeX. 
The AAPM styles for REV\TeX~4 include Bib\TeX\ style file
\verb+aapmrev4-2.bst+, appropriate for
numbered bibliography. 
REV\TeX~4 will automatically choose the style appropriate for 
the document's selected class options: the default is numerical.

This sample file demonstrates a simple use of Bib\TeX\ 
via a \verb+\bibliography+ command referencing the \verb+aapmsamp.bib+ file.
Running Bib\TeX\ (in this case \texttt{bibtex
aapmsamp}) after the first pass of \LaTeX\ produces the file
\verb+aapmsamp.bbl+ which contains the automatically formatted
\verb+\bibitem+ commands (including extra markup information via
\verb+\bibinfo+ commands). If not using Bib\TeX, the
\verb+thebibiliography+ environment should be used instead.

\paragraph{Fourth-level heading is run in.}%
Footnotes are produced using the \verb+\footnote{#1}+ command. 
Numerical style citations put footnotes into the 
bibliography\footnote{Automatically placing footnotes into the bibliography requires using BibTeX to compile the bibliography.}.
Note: due to the method used to place footnotes in the bibliography, \emph{you
must re-run BibTeX every time you change any of your document's
footnotes}. 

\section{Math and Equations}
Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
\verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
\verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will flush left by
default.

Below we have numbered single-line equations, the most common kind: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
|{\bf p}|+p_z\\
px+ip_y
\end{array}\right)\;,
\\
\left\{%
 \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}%
\label{eq:one}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

Not all numbered equations will fit within a narrow column this
way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
on the same line with a one-line equation:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}.
\end{equation}

When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
\[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]

\subsection{Multiline equations}

Multiline equations are obtained by using the \verb+eqnarray+
environment.  Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line
to avoid assigning a number:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
\delta_{\sigma_1,-\sigma_2}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_jl_i\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1),
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\nonumber \\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
  \sum_{\text{perm}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \sum_\tau c^f_\tau~.
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{Note:} Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline
equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect
cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for
using a Roman font within a math environment.

To set a multiline equation without \emph{any} equation
numbers, use the \verb+\begin{eqnarray*}+,
\verb+\end{eqnarray*}+ format:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
 \left(
  \sum_{\text{perm}}\frac{1}{S_{12}S_{23}S_{n1}}
 \right)
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}~.
\end{eqnarray*}
To obtain numbers not normally produced by the automatic numbering,
use the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command, where \verb+#1+ is the desired
equation number. For example, to get an equation number of
(\ref{eq:mynum}),
\begin{equation}
g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \tag{2.6$'$}\label{eq:mynum}
\end{equation}

A few notes on \verb=\tag{#1}=. \verb+\tag{#1}+ requires
\texttt{amsmath}. The \verb+\tag{#1}+ must come before the
\verb+\label{#1}+, if any. The numbering set with \verb+\tag{#1}+ is
\textit{transparent} to the automatic numbering in REV\TeX{};
therefore, the number must be known ahead of time, and it must be
manually adjusted if other equations are added. \verb+\tag{#1}+ works
with both single-line and multiline equations. \verb+\tag{#1}+ should
only be used in exceptional case - do not use it to number all
equations in a paper.

Note the equation number gets reset again:
\begin{equation}
g^+g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. 
\end{equation}

Enclosing single-line and multiline equations in
\verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
a set of equations that are ``numbered'' with letters, as shown in
Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:whole}
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
\right\},\label{subeq:1}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
Putting a \verb+\label{#1}+ command right after the
\verb+\begin{subequations}+, allows one to
reference all the equations in a subequations environment. For
example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

\subsubsection{Wide equations}
The equation that follows is set in a wide format, i.e., it spans
across the full page. The wide format is reserved for long equations
that cannot be easily broken into four lines or less:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
{\cal R}^{(\text{d})}=
 g_{\sigma_2}^e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^Z(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^Z(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)
 + x_WQ_e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)\;. \label{eq:wideeq}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
This is typed to show the output is in wide format.
(Since there is no input line between \verb+\equation+ and
this paragraph, there is no paragraph indent for this paragraph.)
\section{Cross-referencing}
REV\TeX{} will automatically number sections, equations, figure
captions, and tables. In order to reference them in text, use the
\verb+\label{#1}+ and \verb+\ref{#1}+ commands. To reference a
particular page, use the \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command.

The \verb+\label{#1}+ should appear in a section heading, within an
equation, or in a table or figure caption. The \verb+\ref{#1}+ command
is used in the text where the citation is to be displayed.  Some
examples: Section~\ref{sec:level1} on page~\pageref{sec:level1},
Table~\ref{tab:table1},%
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table1}This is a narrow table which fits into a
text column when using \texttt{twocolumn} formatting. Note that
REV\TeX~4 adjusts the intercolumn spacing so that the table fills the
entire width of the column. Table captions are numbered
automatically. This table illustrates left-aligned, centered, and
right-aligned columns.  }
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
Left\footnote{Note a.}&Centered\footnote{Note b.}&Right\\
\hline
1 & 2 & 3\\
10 & 20 & 30\\
100 & 200 & 300\\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}
and Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}.

\section{Figures and Tables}
Figures and tables are typically ``floats''; \LaTeX\ determines their
final position via placement rules. 
\LaTeX\ isn't always successful in automatically placing floats where you wish them.

Figures are marked up with the \texttt{figure} environment, the content of which
imports the image (\verb+\includegraphics+) followed by the figure caption (\verb+\caption+).
The argument of the latter command should itself contain a \verb+\label+ command if you
wish to refer to your figure with \verb+\ref+.

Import your image using either the \texttt{graphics} or
\texttt{graphix} packages. These packages both define the
\verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command, but they differ in the optional
arguments for specifying the orientation, scaling, and translation of the figure.
Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}%
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics{fig_1}% Here is how to import EPS art
%\caption{\label{fig:epsart} A figure caption. The figure captions are
%automatically numbered.}
%\end{figure}
is small enough to fit in a single column, while
Fig.~\ref{fig:wide}%
%\begin{figure*}
%\includegraphics{fig_2}% Here is how to import EPS art
%\caption{\label{fig:wide}Use the \texttt{figure*} environment to get a wide
%figure, spanning the page in \texttt{twocolumn} formatting.}
%\end{figure*}
is too wide for a single column,
so instead the \texttt{figure*} environment has been used.

The analog of the \texttt{figure} environment is \texttt{table}, which uses
the same \verb+\caption+ command.
However, you should type your caption command first within the \texttt{table}, 
instead of last as you did for \texttt{figure}.

The heart of any table is the \texttt{tabular} environment,
which represents the table content as a (vertical) sequence of table rows,
each containing a (horizontal) sequence of table cells. 
Cells are separated by the \verb+&+ character;
the row terminates with \verb+\\+. 
The required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment
specifies how data are displayed in each of the columns. 
For instance, a column
may be centered (\verb+c+), left-justified (\verb+l+), right-justified (\verb+r+),
or aligned on a decimal point (\verb+d+). 
(Table~\ref{tab:table4}%
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table4}Numbers in columns Three--Five have been
aligned by using the ``d'' column specifier (requires the
\texttt{dcolumn} package). 
Non-numeric entries (those entries without
a ``.'') in a ``d'' column are aligned on the decimal point. 
Use the
``D'' specifier for more complex layouts. }
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{ccddd}
One&Two&\mbox{Three}&\mbox{Four}&\mbox{Five}\\
\hline
one&two&\mbox{three}&\mbox{four}&\mbox{five}\\
He&2& 2.77234 & 45672. & 0.69 \\
C\footnote{Some tables require footnotes.}
  &C\footnote{Some tables need more than one footnote.}
  & 12537.64 & 37.66345 & 86.37 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}
illustrates the use of decimal column alignment.)

Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, although
REV\TeX~4 sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the
table.
Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+
command.
The doubled (or Scotch) rules that appear at the top and
bottom of a table can be achieved by enclosing the \texttt{tabular}
environment within a \texttt{ruledtabular} environment.
Rows whose columns span multiple columns can be typeset using \LaTeX's
\verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command
(for example, see the first row of Table~\ref{tab:table3}).%
\begin{table*}
\caption{\label{tab:table3}This is a wide table that spans the page
width in \texttt{twocolumn} mode. It is formatted using the
\texttt{table*} environment. It also demonstrates the use of
\textbackslash\texttt{multicolumn} in rows with entries that span
more than one column.}
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 &\multicolumn{2}{c}{$D_{4h}^1$}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{$D_{4h}^5$}\\
 Ion&1st alternative&2nd alternative&lst alternative
&2nd alternative\\ \hline
 K&$(2e)+(2f)$&$(4i)$ &$(2c)+(2d)$&$(4f)$ \\
 Mn&$(2g)$\footnote{The $z$ parameter of these positions is $z\sim\frac{1}{4}$.}
 &$(a)+(b)+(c)+(d)$&$(4e)$&$(2a)+(2b)$\\
 Cl&$(a)+(b)+(c)+(d)$&$(2g)$\footnote{This is a footnote in a table that spans the full page
width in \texttt{twocolumn} mode. It is supposed to set on the full width of the page, just as the caption does. }
 &$(4e)^{\text{a}}$\\
 He&$(8r)^{\text{a}}$&$(4j)^{\text{a}}$&$(4g)^{\text{a}}$\\
 Ag& &$(4k)^{\text{a}}$& &$(4h)^{\text{a}}$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table*}

The tables in this document illustrate various effects.
Tables that fit in a narrow column are contained in a \texttt{table}
environment.
Table~\ref{tab:table3} is a wide table, therefore set with the
\texttt{table*} environment.
Lengthy tables may need to break across pages.
A simple way to allow this is to specify
the \verb+[H]+ float placement on the \texttt{table} or
\texttt{table*} environment.
Alternatively, using the standard \LaTeXe\ package \texttt{longtable} 
gives more control over how tables break and allows headers and footers 
to be specified for each page of the table.
An example of the use of \texttt{longtable} can be found
in the file \texttt{summary.tex} that is included with the REV\TeX~4
distribution.

There are two methods for setting footnotes within a table (these
footnotes will be displayed directly below the table rather than at
the bottom of the page or in the bibliography).
The easiest
and preferred method is just to use the \verb+\footnote{#1}+
command. This will automatically enumerate the footnotes with
lowercase roman letters.
However, it is sometimes necessary to have
multiple entries in the table share the same footnote.
In this case,
create the footnotes using
\verb+\footnotemark[#1]+ and \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+.
\texttt{\#1} is a numeric value.
Each time the same value for \texttt{\#1} is used, 
the same mark is produced in the table. 
The \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+ commands are placed after the \texttt{tabular}
environment. 
Examine the \LaTeX\ source and output for Tables~\ref{tab:table1} and 
\ref{tab:table2}%
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table2}A table with more columns still fits
properly in a column. Note that several entries share the same
footnote. Inspect the \LaTeX\ input for this table to see
exactly how it is done.}

for an illustration. 

All AAPM journals require that the initial citation of
figures or tables be in numerical order.
\LaTeX's automatic numbering of floats is your friend here:
just put each \texttt{figure} environment immediately following 
its first reference (\verb+\ref+), as we have done in this example file.

\appendix

\section{Appendixes}

To start the appendixes, use the \verb+\appendix+ command.
This signals that all following section commands refer to appendixes
instead of regular sections. Therefore, the \verb+\appendix+ command
should be used only once---to set up the section commands to act as
appendixes. Thereafter normal section commands are used. The heading
for a section can be left empty. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\section{}
\end{verbatim}
will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A'' and
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\section{Background}
\end{verbatim}
will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND''
(note that the colon is set automatically).

If there is only one appendix, then the letter ``A'' should not
appear. This is suppressed by using the star version of the appendix
command (\verb+\appendix*+ in the place of \verb+\appendix+).

\section{A little more on appendixes}

Observe that this appendix was started by using
\begin{verbatim}
\section{A little more on appendixes}
\end{verbatim}

Note the equation number in an appendix:
\begin{equation}
E=mc^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{\label{app:subsec}A subsection in an appendix}

You can use a subsection or subsubsection in an appendix. Note the
numbering: we are now in Appendix~\ref{app:subsec}.

\subsubsection{\label{app:subsubsec}A subsubsection in an appendix}
Note the equation numbers in this appendix, produced with the
subequations environment:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
E&=&mc, \label{appa}
\\
E&=&mc^2, \label{appb}
\\
E&\agt& mc^3. \label{appc}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
They turn out to be Eqs.~(\ref{appa}), (\ref{appb}), and (\ref{appc}).
